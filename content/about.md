Hello I am Ravi Chamarthy and Welcome to my WebBook.

![:left::round](https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/819205?s=400&u=2f61ca4eb7305bdb5dd9256416074476d3545a79&v=4)

I work at [Cisco Systems](https://www.cisco.com) as Director of
Engineering building [Nexus Dashboard](https://www.cisco.com/go/nexusdashboard)
to simplify datacenter network operations and management. Prior to this gig,
I held various positions as an engineer at Insieme Networks, Juniper Networks, and
Hewlett Packard Company. I am a distributed systems engineer by trade, passionate
about building products that simplify the operation of the network, compute,
and storage deployments across on-premise and cloud.

I hold a Bachelors of Engineering Degree in Civil Engineering and a Masters of
Engineering in Software Systems from [BITS Pilani](https://bits-pilani.ac.in/).

In my copious free time, I prefer hacking around container technologies, devops
tooling and/or build that odd library in golang or python3 for (re)use.
