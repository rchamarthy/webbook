Hello, I am Ravi Chamarthy and Welcome to my WebBook.

![:left::round](https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/819205?s=400&u=2f61ca4eb7305bdb5dd9256416074476d3545a79&v=4)

I work at [Cisco Systems](https://www.cisco.com) as Director of
Engineering building [Nexus Dashboard](https://www.cisco.com/go/nexusdashboard)
to simplify datacenter network operations and management. Before this gig,
I held various positions as an engineer at Insieme Networks, Juniper Networks, and
Hewlett Packard Company. I am a distributed systems engineer by trade, passionate
about building products that simplify the operation of the network, compute,
and storage deployments across on-premise and cloud.

I hold a Bachelors of Engineering Degree in Civil Engineering and a Masters of
Engineering in Software Systems from [BITS Pilani](https://bits-pilani.ac.in/).

In my copious free time, I prefer hacking around container technologies, DevOps
tooling or build that odd library in golang or python3 for (re)use.

## About WebBook

WebBook is my blog. Here I will write about the tools and technologies
I use daily, constructively critique systems that I interact with or
post a hack I discovered getting through my day.

My knowledge is built by observing systems built by others, interacting
with my fellow engineers, and reading articles written by diligent technologists, who document their findings. This website is an effort to spread that tribal
knowledge to as many people as possible.

A word of caution, while I will make my best effort to make the articles as
accurate as possible, some may become irrelevant over time, and others may have
gaps. As always, take the best, compare it with your notes and other readings
and draw your conclusions. If you find something for me to improve,
please issue a pull request against the articles.
