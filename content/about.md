Hello, I am Ravi Chamarthy, and Welcome to my WebBook.

![:left::round](https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/819205?s=400&u=2f61ca4eb7305bdb5dd9256416074476d3545a79&v=4)

I am a Senior Director of Engineering at [Cisco Systems](https://www.cisco.com),
building [Nexus Dashboard](https://www.cisco.com/go/nexusdashboard)
to simplify data center network operations and management. Before Cisco, I held
various engineering leadership positions at Insieme Networks, Juniper Networks,
and Hewlett Packard Company. With deep expertise in distributed systems
engineering, I am passionate about building products that simplify the operation
of the network, compute, and storage deployments across on-premise and cloud.

I hold a Bachelor of Engineering Degree in Civil Engineering and a Master of
Engineering Degree in Software Systems from [BITS Pilani](https://bits-pilani.ac.in/).

In my "copious free time," I prefer hacking around container technologies,
DevOps tooling, or building that odd library in golang or python3 for (re)use.

For a full bio, please see my [LinkedIn page](https://linkedin.com/in/ravinag).

## About WebBook

WebBook is my blog to share the tools and technologies I use most often,
constructively assess and critique systems or post a hack I discovered that will
be useful for the broader community.

My knowledge comes from years of building large-scale distributed systems,
observing systems built by others, interacting with my fellow engineers and peer
group, and reading articles written by diligent technologists. This blog
aims to disseminate that synthesized tribal knowledge to a broader
readership.

While I will strive to ensure that the posts are as accurate as possible, some
may become irrelevant due to changes in software and systems over time. Please
consider this best effort, compare it with your notes and other observations,
and draw relevant conclusions. If you would like to provide any feedback or
thoughts, please file an issue or a pull request on the
[webbook](https://github.com/rchamarthy/webbook) repo.
