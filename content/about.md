Hello, I am Ravi Chamarthy and Welcome to my WebBook.

![:left::round](https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/819205?s=400&u=2f61ca4eb7305bdb5dd9256416074476d3545a79&v=4)

I am a Director of Engineering at [Cisco Systems](https://www.cisco.com)
building [Nexus Dashboard](https://www.cisco.com/go/nexusdashboard) to simplify
datacenter network operations and management. Prior to Cisco, I held various
engineering leadership positions at Insieme Networks, Juniper Networks, and
Hewlett Packard Company. With deep expertise in distributed systems engineering,
I am passionate about building products that simplify the operation of the
network, compute, and storage deployments across on-premise and cloud.

I hold a Bachelors of Engineering Degree in Civil Engineering and a Masters of
Engineering in Software Systems from [BITS Pilani](https://bits-pilani.ac.in/).

In my "copious free time", I prefer hacking around container technologies, DevOps
tooling or build that odd library in golang or python3 for (re)use.

For a full bio, please see my [LinkedIn page](https://linkedin.com/in/ravinag).

## About WebBook

WebBook is my blog that I built to share about the tools and technologies that
I use most often, constructively assess and critique systems or post a hack
I discover that will be useful for the broader community.

My knowledge is built from years of building large scale distributed systems and
by observing systems built by others, interactions with my fellow engineers and
peer group, to reading articles written by diligent technologists. This blog is
an effort to disseminate that synthesized tribal knowledge to a broader
readership.

While I will strive to ensure that the posts are as accurate as possible, some
may become irrelevant due to changes in software and systems over time. Please
consider this best effort, compare it with your notes and other observations and
draw your own relevant conclusions. If you would like to provide any feedback or
thoughts, please file an issue or a pull request on the
[webbook](https://github.com/rchamarthy/webbook) repo.
